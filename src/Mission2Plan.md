# Mission 2 Meeting Plan

## Breakdown of Mission tasks

- Fixes so this is true: Users can borrow your stablecoin against their multi-collateral position up to the LTV allowed by their aggregate collateral with the borrow function.
- Liquidity for your stablecoin so it can be swapped on a decentralized exchange in your local environment.
- Positions that fall below the required LTV ratio for their basket of collateral and corresponding borrow amount can be “liquidated” (force-closed) with a liquidate function.

Governance proposals may be executed:
- Governance proposals must have passed the 5 day voting period since proposal to be executable.
- Governance proposals cannot be voted on outside of the 5 day voting period.
- Only proposals with >50% of the totalSupply in voting power may be executed.
- When governance proposals are executed, the proposed ltv is configured in the CDP system for the defined collateralToken.

- Governance tokens may be staked in a Staker contract.
- Interest fees that are generated from the CDP protocol debt are distributed to stakers.
